## Final Conclusion Statement

Analyzing the data it tells me that there was more drivers than rides in Urban Cities, Rural Cities than in Suburban cities. 

## Recommendation #1

I’d recommend more drivers in the Suburban and Rural areas. 

## Recommendation #2

I’d recommend finding out what holidays is the drips in fares collected in March. As there was a noticeable surge in February and then it dips in February. Possibly due to a glitch within the system. 

## Recommendation #3

I’d recommend advertising and sponsoring events to educate new riders about the companies service.
